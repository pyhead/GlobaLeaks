GlobaLeaks
==========

GlobaLeaks empowers people to report on malpractice and abuse on a local level anonymously. By blowing the whistle on entities people are able to transform information into action.
The flexibility of GlobaLeaks make it suitable for various different kinds of whistleblowing initiatives. An activist should be enabled to use the GlobaLeaks platform but it should scale
to also be applied to a corporation, public administration or newspaper.
