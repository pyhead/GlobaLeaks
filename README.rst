GlobaLeaks
==========

GlobaLeaks empowers people to report on malpractice and abuse on a local level anonymously. By blowing the whistle on entities people are able to transform information into action.
The flexibility of GlobaLeaks make it suitable for various different kinds of whistleblowing initiatives. An activist should be enabled to use the GlobaLeaks platform but it should scale
to also be applied to a corporation, public administration or newspaper.

Development Guidelines
======================

Globaleaks uses three main branches for development:

  - `master` - which contains an aproximately stable revision of the repo, code
             clean (which means >= 6 over pylnt) ready for deployment.
  - `backend-devel` - used to keep track of changes over the backend/ directory.
  - `client-devel` - used to keep track of changes over the client/ directory.

Other branches, such as `0.1` are still open for bugfixing.
